# Promises implementation

A reproduction of a promise implementation. 
It rebuilds the project developed by Alex Rauschmayer and explained in [his book](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_promises.html#sec_demo-promise) in the chapter about Promises. 

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need to have Node.js installed. If you don't have it, please go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website, download and install it. 

Then you can install this application, by (forking and) downloading it and then running the command `npm install` from your terminal.

Run the tests by copying and typing the command you can find at the beginning of the test file. 

## Notes and Acknowledgments

All the code in this project is copied from the original work [Demo Promises by Alex Rauschmeyer](https://github.com/rauschma/demo_promise). I rebuilt it step by step for self study purposes only.
Read the relative paragraph in [his book](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_promises.html#sec_demo-promise) for an explanation of the code.
